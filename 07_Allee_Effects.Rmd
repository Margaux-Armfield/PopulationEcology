#### Assignment 7: Allee Effects
dn/dt=rn(1−nK)(n−aK)

Your task is to numerically solve this model using ode . You should create a function PE_AlleeGrowth_Cont, which you should be able to adapt from the function PE_LogisticGrowth_Cont. The function should have 3 arguments:
n0: which is the starting value of n
parms: a list of model parameters with three elements r, K, and a
t : the number of generations to run
and should return a data.frame with a column for time and a column for n.

Call the function you created and create a graph of the population density up to 50 time steps, Plot the dynamics of 2 populations one that starts with a density n0= 5 and one that starts from a population density n0 = 15 with parameter values:
r=0.5, a=10, and K=100.

#### Answer:

```{r Allee effects}
library(deSolve)

PE_AlleeGrowth_Cont <- function(n0, parms, t)
{
  logistic.model.ODE <- function(t, n, parms)
  {
    dn.dt <- parms$r*n*(1-n/parms$K)*((n-parms$a)/parms$K)
    return(list(c(dn.dt))) #returns a list with one element which is a vector
  }
  
  #initial varaible is n0, set up as a vector with one, named element
  inits <- c(n = n0)
  p <- list(r = parms$r, K = parms$K, a = parms$a)
  times <- 0:t # by represents your time step
  
  out <- ode(inits, times, func = logistic.model.ODE, parms = p)
  return(as.data.frame(out))
}
p <- list(r=0.5, K=100, a = 10)
pop1 <-PE_AlleeGrowth_Cont(n0=5, parms=p, t=50)
pop2 <-PE_AlleeGrowth_Cont(n0=15, parms=p, t=50)

max.y <- max(c(pop1$n, pop2$n))

plot(pop1$time, pop1$n, col="hot pink", type = 'l', ylim = c(0,max.y))
lines(pop2$time, pop2$n, col="blue")
```
